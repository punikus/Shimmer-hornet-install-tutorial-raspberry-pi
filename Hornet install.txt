# This is shimmer hornet install tutorial for raspberry pi os lite (64BIT)
you will have to use this OS for hornet node.

#First of all you will have to open following ports on your router for raspberry pi: 15600/tcp, 14626/udp and 80/tpc

# Set superuser privileges:
sudo su

# install firewall
apt install ufw
ufw default allow outgoing
ufw default deny incoming
ufw allow ssh
ufw allow 80/tcp
ufw allow 14626/udp
ufw allow 15600/tcp
ufw enable


# Add Docker's official GPG key:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg


# Add the repository to Apt sources:
echo \
  "deb [arch="$(dpkg --print-architecture)" signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian \
  "$(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME")" stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update


# Install docker & docker compose plugin:
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
apt update && apt upgrade -y


# Install hornet. I installed the latest version of stardust (shimmer) hornet node, if you want IOTA hornet node, you got to choose crysalis
 version on https://github.com/iotaledger/node-docker-setup/releases:
mkdir hornet
cd hornet
curl -L -O "https://github.com/iotaledger/node-docker-setup/releases/download/v1.0.0-rc.16/node-docker-setup_stardust-v1.0.0-rc.16.tar.gz"
tar -zxf node-docker-setup_stardust-v1.0.0-rc.16.tar.gz

# With next command you will get your hash and your salt for the dashboard. just copy-paste when you get them for next step: 
docker compose run hornet tool pwd-hash
# You will get this two...
  Your hash: 
  Your salt: 

# Create .env file with nano command for dashboard use and just copy the template under and paste it in the .env file. 
NODE_HOST is your raspberry pi IP adress, I set it in my router always to be the same IP for raspberry pi, but i don't know if that is necessary. 
DASHBOARD_PASSWORD is your hash that you generated in previous step and DASHBOARD_SALT is your salt:

nano .env

COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml
NODE_HOST=
DASHBOARD_PASSWORD=
DASHBOARD_SALT=

# Save and exit .env file

# Examle
COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml
NODE_HOST=192.186.183.40
DASHBOARD_PASSWORD=aeddf654ed3a56edf4s6a3ed5df46s35ref43sa5eef43w5e4f36we54f
DASHBOARD_SALT=tyuj54t6fjyu46t85j46t8u47yj6t5j4f68e7r6eytwt6er5tete452t

# Create the data folder:
./prepare_docker.sh

# Start the node:
docker compose up -d

# Stop the node:
docker compose down


# After starting the node you will be able to access your services in the browser at http://localhost/dashboard,
just change localhost with your raspberrys IP.Or you can try your raspberry pi IP adress following :80 Example 192.168.183.40:80 . Good luck, i hope this helped you...

# I copy paste commands from official docker site, that's why "sudo" is in front, but it works this way also.
